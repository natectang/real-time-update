# Real-Time-Update
● Instant releases/rollbacks: Implement a “listener”, such that when the flag is toggled, the
application instantly switches to the new/old code (i.e. no page reload required)
● Remediate: Use a trigger to turn off a problematic feature (can be done manually, e.g. via
curl, or via a browser).
